        <h2>IMPACTS OF INTEREST RATES</h2>
        <img src="interest -rates.jpg" alt="interest-rates">
    </div>
    
    <p>Interest rates have a significant impact on how loans are structured and repaid, influencing the borrowerâ€™s financial burden and the overall cost of the loan. When interest rates are higher, a larger portion of each monthly payment is allocated toward interest, meaning less goes toward paying down the principal in the early stages of the loan. This leads to higher monthly payments, making it more challenging for borrowers to manage their debt. Conversely, lower interest rates mean that more of the payment goes toward reducing the principal, resulting in lower monthly payments and a faster decrease in the loan balance.</p>
    
    <p>The total cost of the loan is directly tied to the interest rate. With higher interest rates, borrowers will pay significantly more in interest over the life of the loan, often resulting in a total repayment amount much greater than the initial loan. On the other hand, with lower interest rates, the overall cost of the loan is reduced, leading to substantial savings over time. Borrowers with lower interest rates can pay off their loans more quickly because a greater proportion of each payment reduces the loan balance from the beginning.</p>
    
    <p>Interest rates also affect the type of loan a borrower might choose. Fixed interest rates provide certainty, as the interest rate remains constant throughout the loan term, allowing for predictable payments. However, borrowers miss out on potential savings if market rates fall. In contrast, variable interest rates fluctuate with market conditions, which can result in lower payments initially, but with the risk of higher payments if rates increase, creating uncertainty in long-term financial planning.</p>
    
    <p>The amortization schedule, which shows how each payment is divided between interest and principal, is also influenced by interest rates. When rates are higher, a borrower will see that early payments primarily go toward covering interest, causing the loan balance to decrease slowly. In contrast, with lower rates, more of each payment is applied to the principal from the start, allowing the borrower to pay off the loan faster.</p>
    
    <p>Lastly, interest rates influence the overall affordability of borrowing. Higher interest rates make loans more expensive, which can reduce demand for borrowing, as individuals and businesses are more cautious about taking on debt. Lower interest rates, however, make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage more people to take out loans, stimulating economic activity by making credit more accessible.</p>
